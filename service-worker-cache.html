@group Service Worker Elements

The `service-worker-cache` element makes it easy to precache specific resources, perform runtime
caching, and serve your cached resources when a network is unavailable.
Under the hood, the [sw-toolbox](https://github.com/googlechrome/sw-toolbox) library is used for
all the caching and request handling logic.
`service-worker-cache` needs to be a child element of `service-worker`.
A simple, yet useful configuration is

    <service-worker>
      <service-worker-cache></service-worker-cache>
    </service-worker>

This is enough to have all of the (local) resources your site uses cached at runtime.
(It uses the default `defaultCacheStrategy` of "networkFirst".)
When there's a network available, visits to your site will go against the network copy of the
resources, but if someone visits your site when they're offline, all the cached resources will
be used.
