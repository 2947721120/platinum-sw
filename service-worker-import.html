@group Service Worker Elements

The `service-worker-import` is used to import a JavaScript file that is executed each time the
service worker starts up.

A common use case is to define a custom request handler for a `fetch`
event, but it can be used for any type of code that you want to be executed by the service worker.

    <service-worker>
      <service-worker-import href="custom-fetch-handler.js"></service-worker-import>
      <service-worker-fetch handler="customFetchHandler"
                            path="/(.*)/customFetch"></service-worker-fetch>
    </service-worker>

You can specify multiple `service-worker-import` elements, each one corresponding to a different
JavaScript file. The JavaScript files will be loaded in the order in which the
`service-worker-import` elements appear. Under the hood, this results in an
[`importScripts()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts)
call made from the context of the service worker.
